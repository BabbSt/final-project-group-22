Hey everyone!

So this is the basic structure of our ACM-W Page:

We have the following pages:
    Home Page<br>
    About Us
    Meet The Officers
    Join Us      (not sure if this will end up being the Home Page)
    Collab
    Blog Page
    404 Page
For each of these pages we have a outer template file in the views/ files (ex: 404Page.handlebars)
