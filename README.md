Hey everyone!

So this is the basic structure of our ACM-W Page:

We have the following pages:
    Home Page<br>
    About Us<br>
    Meet The Officers<br>
    Join Us (not sure if this will end up being the Home Page)<br>
    Collab<br>
    Blog Page<br>
    404 Page<br>
For each of these pages we have a outer template file in the views/ files (ex: 404Page.handlebars)

We have the partials folder with all of the content that will stay the same structure but just have different content within it (like the twits we did).
