Hey everyone!

So this is the basic structure of our ACM-W Page:

We have the following pages:
    Home Page<br>
    About Us<br>
    Meet The Officers<br>
    Join Us (not sure if this will end up being the Home Page)<br>
    Collab<br>
    Blog Page<br>
    404 Page<br>
For each of these pages we have a outer template file in the views/ files (ex: 404Page.handlebars)

We have the partials folder with all of the content that will stay the same structure but just have different content within it (like the twits we did).

There will be ONE css file so we can keep styles consistant. Please CLONE THESE FILES and use them rather than upload your own files and adjusting them later!

Lets keep the fonts and text styles the same as much as possible. These are the fonts we are using:
